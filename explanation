Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs are fixed
The names of the inputs and outputs are fixed
The inputs: Serial input RX (connected to the keyboard, or a .dat file), dip switches, push buttons, clock speed slider
The outpus: LCD matrix, discrete LEDs, 7-segment display, serial monitor
The clock speed is assumed to be 50MHz (although might run slower in simulation)

The Logic
The clock runs at max CPU speed (As much as the host PC allows)
The GUI is updated with the latest state at 60 FPS
The actuation of GUI inputs will trigger events (callback handlers), which update the verilator inputs
Each clock tick or input change (from GUI) will cause the states to be dumped (for GTKWave)

The user will write his verilog code, will run a bash script, the code will compile and the GUI will run, exposing the inputs and outputs.
